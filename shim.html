        Shimla


    </h1>

    <p>


        Shimla (English: /ˈʃɪmlə/; Hindi: [ˈʃɪmla] ⓘ; also known as Simla, the official name until 1972)[11] is the capital and the largest city of the northern Indian state of Himachal Pradesh. In 1864, Shimla was declared the summer capital of British India.
        After independence, the city became the capital of East Punjab and was later made the capital city of Himachal Pradesh. It is the principal commercial, cultural and educational centre of the state. Small hamlets were recorded before 1815 when
        British forces took control of the area. The climatic conditions attracted the British to establish the city in the dense forests of the Himalayas. As the summer capital, Shimla hosted many important political meetings including the Simla Deputation
        of 1906, the Simla Accord of 1914 and the Simla Conference of 1945. After independence, the state of Himachal Pradesh came into being in 1948 as a result of the integration of 28 princely states. Even after independence, the city remained an important
        political centre, hosting the Simla Agreement of 1972. After the reorganisation of the state of Himachal Pradesh, the existing Mahasu district was named Shimla. Shimla is home to several buildings that are styled in the Tudorbethan and neo-Gothic
        architectures dating from the colonial era, as well as multiple temples and churches. The colonial architecture and churches, the temples, and the natural environment of the city attract tourists. Major city centre's attractions include the Shri
        Hanuman Jakhu (Statue), Jakhu Temple, Viceregal Lodge, Christ Church, Mall Road, The Ridge and Annadale. The city centre's northernmost point is Jakhoo and the southernmost location is Annadale, the easternmost point is Sanjauli and the western
        point is Chotta Shimla. The Kalka–Shimla Railway line built by the British, a UNESCO World Heritage Site, is also a major tourist attraction. Owing to its steep terrain, Shimla hosts the mountain biking race MTB Himalaya, which started in 2005
        and is regarded as the biggest event of its kind in South Asia. Shimla also has the largest natural ice skating rink in South Asia. Apart from being a tourism centre, the city is also an educational hub with several colleges and research institutions.

        Etymology

    </h1>
    <p>
        One theory suggests that the name "Shimla" was derived from Shyamalaya, meaning 'blue house', a solitary house made of blue slate on Jakhu Hill, built by a fakir.[12] According to another version, the city gets its name from Shamli or Shyamala, meaning
        'blue lady', referring to the goddess Kali. It is believed that a temple dedicated to goddess Shamli, an incarnation of Kali, used to be on the Jakhu hillside near the Rothney Castle.[12][13] Many believe that during the British period, the image
        of the goddess was shifted to a new place, the now-famous Kali Bari Temple.[14] In 2018, the state government decided to change the city's name from Shimla to Shyamala.[15] However, seeing the negative response of the general public, the state
        government dismissed the plan.[16]

        History
    </h1>


    <p>
        Most of the area occupied by present-day Shimla city was dense forest during the 18th century. The only sign of civilisation was the Jakhu Temple and a few scattered houses.[17] The area was called 'Shimla', named after Hindu goddess Shyamala Devi, an
        incarnation of Kali.[2] The bridge connecting Shimla with Chhota Shimla, originally erected in 1829 by Lord Combermere, Shimla, the 1850s The area of present-day Shimla was invaded and captured by Bhimsen Thapa of Nepal in 1806. The British East
        India Company took control of the territory as per the Sugauli Treaty after the Anglo-Nepalese War (1814–16). The Gurkha leaders were quelled by storming the fort of Malaun under the command of David Ochterlony in May 1815. In a diary entry dated
        30 August 1817, the Gerard brothers, who surveyed the area, describe Shimla as "a middling-sized village where a fakir is situated to give water to the travellers". In 1819, Lieutenant Ross, the Assistant Political Agent in the Hill States, set
        up a wood cottage in Shimla. Three years later, his successor and the Scottish civil servant Charles Pratt Kennedy built the first pucca house in the area named Kennedy Cottage in 1822, near Annadale, what is now the home for CPWD office. The
        accounts of the Britain-like climate started attracting several British officers to the area during the hot Indian summers. By 1826, some officers had started spending their entire vacation in Shimla. In 1827, William Amherst, the Governor-General
        of Bengal, visited Shimla and stayed in the Kennedy House. A year later, Stapleton Cotton, the Commander-in-Chief of the British forces in India, stayed at the same residence. During his stay, a three-mile road and a bridge were constructed near
        Jakhoo. In 1830, the British acquired the surrounding land from the chiefs of Keonthal and Patiala in exchange for the Rawin pargana and a portion of the Bharauli pargana. The settlement grew rapidly after this, from 30 houses in 1830 to 1,141
        houses in 1881.[17][18] In 1832, Shimla saw its first political meeting between the Governor-General Lord William Bentinck and the emissaries of Maharaja Ranjit Singh. In a letter to Colonel Churchill, he wrote:[19] Combermere's successor Earl
        Dalhousie visited Shimla in the same year. After this, the town was under Nawab (King) Kumar Ghosal of Bally, West Bengal, and saw regular visits from the Governors-General and Commanders-in-Chief of British India. Several young British officers
        started visiting the area to socialise with the higher-ups; they were followed by ladies looking for marriage alliances for their relatives. Shimla thus became a hill station famous for balls, parties, and other festivities. Subsequently, residential
        schools for pupils from upper-class families were established nearby. By the late 1830s, the city also became a centre for theatre and art exhibitions. As the population increased, several bungalows were built and a big bazaar was established
        in the town. The Indian businessmen, mainly from Sood and Parsi communities, arrived in the area to cater to the needs of the growing European population. On 9 September 1844, the foundation of the Christ Church was laid. Subsequently, several
        roads were widened and the construction of the Hindustan-Tibet road with a 560-feet tunnel was taken up in 1851–52. This tunnel, now known as the Dhalli Tunnel, was started by Major Briggs in 1850 and completed in the winter of 1851–52.[20] The
        1857 uprising caused a panic among the European residents of the town, but Shimla remained largely unaffected by the rebellion.[17] In 1863, the Viceroy of India, John Lawrence, decided to shift the summer capital of the British Raj to Shimla.[17]
        He took the trouble of moving the administration twice a year between Calcutta and this separate centre over 1,000 miles away, even though it was difficult to reach.[21] Robert Bulwer-Lytton (Viceroy of India 1876–1880) made efforts to plan the
        town from 1876, when he first stayed in a rented house, but began plans for a Viceregal Lodge, later built on Observatory Hill. A fire cleared much of the area where the native Indian population lived (the "Upper Bazaar" nowadays known as the
        Ridge[22]), and the planning of the eastern end to become the centre of the European town forced them to live in the Middle and Lower Bazaars on the lower terraces descending the steep slopes from the Ridge. The Upper Bazaar was cleared for a
        town hall, with many facilities such as a library and theatre, as well as offices for police and military volunteers as well as municipal administration. During the "Hot Weather", Shimla was also the headquarters of the Commander-in-Chief, India,
        the head of the Indian Army, and many departments of the Government of India. The summer capital of the regional Government of the Punjab moved from Murree, in modern-day Pakistan, to Shimla in 1876. They were joined by many of the British wives
        and daughters of the men who remained on the plains. Together these formed the Shimla Society, which, according to Charles Allen,[23] "was as close as British India ever came to having an upper crust." This may have been helped by the fact that
        it was very expensive, having an ideal climate and thus being desirable, as well as having limited accommodation. British soldiers, merchants, and civil servants moved here each year to escape from the heat during summer in the Indo-Gangetic plain.
        The presence of many bachelors and unattached men, as well as the many women passing the hot weather there, gave Shimla a reputation for adultery, and at least gossip about adultery: as Rudyard Kipling said in a letter cited by Allen, it had a
        reputation for "frivolity, gossip, and intrigue".[24] The 500-foot (150 m) Lower Bazaar tunnel was built in 1905 and christened Khachhar Surang. The Elysium Tunnel (now known as the Auckland Tunnel), about 120 feet (37 m) in length, was also built
        in 1905.[20] The Simla Convention, an ambiguous treaty concerning the status of Tibet negotiated by representatives of the Republic of China, Tibet and Great Britain was signed in Simla in 1913 and 1914.[25][26] At the convention a demarcation
        line between Tibet and the North-east region of India was proposed by Sir Henry McMahon. The line came to be known as McMahon Line and is currently the effective boundary between China and India, although its legal status is disputed by the Chinese
        government. This was also the site of a series of talks held by Viceroy Wavell to discuss a plan for the independence of India with the Indian political leaders of the time. Known as the Simla Conference, the talks failed to bring about a resolution.

        Planning in Himachal Pradesh started in 1951 along with the rest of India with the implementation of the first five-year plan. The First Plan allocated ₹52.7 million to Himachal Pradesh.[53] More than 50% of this expenditure was incurred on transport
        and communication; while the power sector got a share of just 4.6%, though it had steadily increased to 7% by the Third Plan.[54] Expenditure on agriculture and allied activities increased from 14.4% in the First Plan to 32% in the Third Plan,
        showing a progressive decline afterwards from 24% in the Fourth Plan to less than 10% in the Tenth Plan.[54] Expenditure on energy sector was 24.2% of the total in the Tenth Plan.[54] The total GDP for 2005–06 was estimated at ₹254 billion as
        against ₹230 billion in the year 2004–05, showing an increase of 10.5%.[55] The GDP for fiscal 2015–16 was estimated at ₹1.110 trillion,[50] which increased to ₹1.247 trillion in 2016–17, recording growth of 6.8%.[51] The per capita income increased
        from ₹130,067 in 2015–16 to ₹147,277 in 2016–17.[50][51] The state government's advance estimates for fiscal 2017–18 stated the total GDP and per capita income as ₹1.359 trillion and ₹158,462, respectively.[52] As of 2018, Himachal is the 22nd-largest
        state economy in India with ₹1.52 lakh crore (US$18 billion) in gross domestic product and has the 13th-highest per capita income (₹160,000 (US$1,800)) among the states and union territories of India.[56] Himachal Pradesh also ranks as the second-best
        performing state in the country on human development indicators after Kerala.[57] One of the Indian government's key initiatives to tackle unemployment is the National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (NREGA). The participation of women in the NREGA
        has been observed to vary across different regions of the nation. As of the year 2009–2010, Himachal Pradesh joined the category of high female participation, recording a 46% share of NREGS (National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme) workdays
        for women. This was a drastic increase from the 13% that was recorded in 2006–2007.[58]

    <h1>Geography</h1>

    <p>

        Shimla is on the south-western ranges of the Himalayas at 31.61°N 77.10°E. It has an average altitude of 2,206 metres (7,238 ft) above mean sea level and extends along a ridge with seven spurs. The city stretches nearly 9.2 kilometres (5.7 mi) from east
        to west.[33] The city is a Zone IV (High Damage Risk Zone) per the Earthquake hazard zoning of India. Weak construction techniques and an increasing population pose a serious threat to the already earthquake prone region.[34][35] There are no
        water bodies near the main city and the closest river, the Sutlej, is about 21 km (13 mi) away.[36] Other rivers that flow through the Shimla district, although further from the city, are the Giri, and Pabbar (both tributaries of Yamuna). The
        green belt in the Shimla planning area is spread over 414 hectares (1,020 acres).[24] The main forests in and around the city are of Pine, Deodar, Oak and Rhododendron.[37] Environmental degradation due to the increasing number of tourists every
        year without the infrastructure to support them has resulted in Shimla losing its popular appeal as an ecotourism spot.[38] Another rising concern in the region are the frequent number of landslides that often take place after heavy rains.[34][39]
        The city is situated 88 km (55 miles) northeast of Kalka, 116 km (72 miles) northeast of Chandigarh, 247 km (154 miles) south of Manali and 350 km (219 miles) northeast of Delhi, the national capital. Kalka can be reached within 2.5 hours, and
        Chandigarh can be reached in 3 hours and 15 minutes. Delhi and Manali are both around 7 hours away from Shimla.[citation needed] To the east of Shimla stand the Choor Mountains (Chuor, 3647m[40]). A passage over these mountains, from the Tons
        River to Shimla is described in Views in India, chiefly among the Himalaya Mountains, by George Francis White[41] with accompanying drawings, Village of Khandoo, on the Ascent to the Choor, and two that were subsequently the subject of poetical
        illustrations by Letitia Elizabeth Landon, namely Crossing the Choor Mountains,[42] and Village of Koghera and Deodar Forest, near the Choor.[43] The accompanying notes record that "During a considerable part of the year, the Choor is hoary with
        snow; and when moonlight falls upon the scene, an effect is produced as if floods of molten silver were poured over the surface. Moonlight in these regions assumes a novel charm." Shimla city is geographically uniquely positioned in such a way,
        that if water is poured on the northern slope at the Ridge ground, it goes to the Arabian Sea via the Sutej River, and if water is poured on the southern slope, it meets the Bay of Bengal through the Yamuna River.
