        Safdarjung's Tomb


    </h1>


    <p>
        Safdarjung's tomb is a sandstone and marble mausoleum in Delhi, India. It was built in 1754 in the late Mughal Empire style for Nawab Safdarjung. The monument has an ambience of spaciousness and an imposing presence with its domed and arched red, brown
        and white coloured structures. Safdarjung, Nawab of Awadh, was made prime minister of the Mughal Empire (Wazir ul-Mamlak-i-Hindustan) when Ahmed Shah Bahadur ascended the throne in 1748. The tomb, within a garden, is in a late version of the style
        of earlier Mughal imperial tombs, most famously the Taj Mahal, with inside "eight paradises" (hasht bihisht) or eight rooms around the main chamber under the dome, and a garden divided into four parts outside. This was the first time someone outside
        the immediate imperial Mughal family built themselves such a tomb and garden complex, reflecting the greatly diminished powers of the emperors by this date.[1]

    <p>

        The structure was constructed in 1754 in the late Mughal architecture style Safdar Jung Mirza Muqim Abul Mansur Khan, popularly known as Safdarjung, was the second Nawab of Awadh. He was very rich and powerful. With the death of Emperor Muhammad Shah
        of the Mughal Empire, he moved to Delhi.[3] When Ahmed Shah ascended the throne of the Mughal Empire in Delhi in 1748, Safdarjung was made the Prime Minister (Vazir) of the empire with the title of Vazir ul-Mamalk-i-Hindustan and at that time
        the empire was on the decline as their rule extended only to North India. [4] As Vazir he usurped all powers under his control as the king was only a puppet, a figurehead, who was into enjoying life with wine, opium, and women. But his control
        over the emperor's family was so cruel that the emperor called the Marathas to rid of their Vazir. The Marathas drove Safdarjung out of Delhi in 1753.[3][4] He died soon thereafter in 1754. After his death, his son Nawab Shujaud Daula pleaded
        with the Mughal Emperor to permit him to erect a tomb for his father in Delhi. He then built the tomb, which was designed by an Abyssininan architect.[4] It was built by Bilal Muhammad Khan, at the cost of three lacs of rupees.[5] To the south
        of this tomb is the historic site of the battle that was fought in 1386 between Timur of Mangol and Sultan Mahmud Khan of the Tughluq dynasty when the latter was defeated.

        Architecture

    </h1>


    <p>

        The Safdarjung tomb, the last monumental tomb garden of the Mughals, was planned and built like an enclosed garden tomb in line with the style of the Humayun tomb and Taj Mahal.[6] It was completed in 1754.[7][8] The slabs from the tomb of Abdul Rahim
        Khankhana were used in the construction of the tomb.[9] The tomb has four key features which are: The Char Bagh plan with the mausoleum at the center, a ninefold floor plan, a five-part façade and a large podium with a hidden stairway.[10] The
        main entry gate to the tomb is two-storied and its façade has very elaborate ornamentation over plastered surfaces and is in ornate purple colour. There is an inscription in Arabic on the surface and its translation reads "When the hero of plain
        bravery departs from the transitory, may he become a resident of god’s paradise". The rear side of the façade, which is seen after entering through the gate, has many rooms and the library. To the right of the gate is the mosque which is a three-domed
        structure marked with stripes.[2][3] Entering through the main gate gives a perfect view of the mausoleum.[2] Its walls are built high and the central dome, which is the main mausoleum of Safdarjung, is built over a terrace. Red and buff stones
        are the materials used for building the main mausoleum which measures 28 metres (92 ft) square. The central chamber, square in shape, has eight partitions with a cenotaph in the middle. Here there are partitions in rectangular shape and the corner
        partitions are in octagonal shape. The interior of the tomb is covered with rococo plaster with decorations. There are four towers around the main tomb at the corners which are polygonal in shape and are provided with kiosks. They have marble
        panels which are faded, and decorated arches. There is an underground chamber in the mausoleum which houses the graves of Safadrjung and his wife. The ceiling of the mosque has been plastered, painted and ornamented.[3] The façade, though built
        in the style of the Taj Mahal, lacks symmetry as the vertical axis has been given prominence which has resulted in an unbalanced appearance to the tomb.[6] The dome is more elongated; the central part has a taller pishtaq. The four minarets at
        the four corners are part of the main mausoleum which was totally a different concept in elevation compared to the Taj Mahal where the towers are detached and away from the facade of the tomb.[10] The architecture of the tomb is praised and also
        derided; it is derided for the lack of proportioning of its various units and use of poor material for construction. Reginald Heber, who was Bishop of Calcutta between 1823 and 1826, based on the light brown colour of the stone used, had observed
        that the tomb has the "colour of potted meat". Even ASI has observed that the marble used for ornamentation in the towers though pleasing is "rather florid".[11] Another observation is that the tomb can not be compared to the Taj Mahal or the
        Humayun Tomb, as, at the time it was built, the Mughal Empire was on the decline and sandstone had to be used and lines were set improperly and the quality appeared "thread bare".[3]
