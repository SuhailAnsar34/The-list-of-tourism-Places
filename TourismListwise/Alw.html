        Etymology

    </h1>


    <p>

        There are several theories about the derivation of the name Alwar. Alexander Cunningham, the British Indian archeologist, believed that the city derived its name from the Salva tribe and was originally Salwapur, then Salwar, Halawar and eventually Alwar,
        According to another school it was known as Aravalpur or the city of Aravali. Some others hold that city is named after Khanzada Alawal Khan Mewati (the Muslim Khanzada prince who wrested Alwar from Nikumbh Rajputs)[citation needed]. A research
        conducted during the reign of Maharaja Jai Singh of Alwar revealed that Maharaja Alaghraj, second son of Maharaja Kakil of Amber. ruled the area in the eleventh century and his territory extended up to the present city of Alwar. He founded the
        city of Alpur in 1106 Vikrami Samvat (1049 A.D.) after his own name which eventually became Alwar[citation needed]. It was formerly spelt as Ulwar but in the reign of Jai Singh the spelling was changed to Alwar[citation needed]. Some sources say
        that the name Alwar comes from the Persian word timber.[1][better source needed]

        History
    </h1>


    <p>
        The ancient name of Alwar is Salva or Salwa.[2][3] Alwar was a part of the Matsya Kingdom, one of the 16 ancient Mahājanapadas.[4] In late Vedic texts (such as the Jaiminiya Brahmana), the Salva or Salvi tribe is described as a non-Vedic tribe that occupied
        Kurukshetra and conquered the Kuru Kingdom[5]The Salvas The Salvas settled along the Yamuna river and the Alwar province of Rajasthan after attacking the Kuru kingdom, and they later accepted Vedic culture by the end of the Vedic era as they converged
        with the remaining Kurus and the Surasena mahajanapada, near Matsya kingdom.[6]
